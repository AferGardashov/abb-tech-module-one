1.Product Initialization
Create a Java class called "Product" with the following components:

Static Block:
Create a static block inside the class to initialize a static variable called "companyName" with a default value, such as "MyCompany".

Non-Static Block:
Create a non-static block (instance initializer) inside the class to initialize a non-static variable called "productID". Start the product ID from 1000 and increment it by 1 for each new product created.

Constructor:
Implement a constructor that takes the product name as an argument.
Inside the constructor, initialize a non-static variable called "productName" with the provided name.
Main Class:

Create a main class called "ProductTest" with a main method.
Inside the main method, prompt the user to enter the name of a product.
Instantiate an object of the "Product" class with the provided product name.
Print out the details of the product, including the company name, product ID, and product name.

2.Design a class called "Counter" to keep track of the number of instances created. Implement a static field called "instanceCount" to count the number of objects created from this class.
Additionally, create a static method called "getInstanceCount()" to return the current count of instances. Test this class by creating multiple instances and accessing the instance count.

3.Create a "Car" class. This class should have the following properties:

Brand (String)
Model (String)
Year of Production (int)
Fuel Type (String)
Speed (double)

Perform the following functions: Constructor method: When creating a Car object, create a constructor that takes the make, model, year, and fuel type information. Set speed to 0 by default.
A method called speed(): Increases the speed of the cart. Gets the amount of speed increase as a parameter.
A method called slow(): Decreases the speed of the cart. Gets the amount of speed reduction as a parameter.
A method called stop(): Resets the speed of the cart.
A method named checkSpeed(): Checks the speed of the cart and checks whether it is above a certain speed limit. If the speed is over the limit, it gives the user a speeding warning.
